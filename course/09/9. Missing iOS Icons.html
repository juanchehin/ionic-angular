<p>If you're <strong>missing some iOS icons</strong> after setting a global toolbar style, you might be facing a bug that I also faced during recording: Ionic doesn't use the toolbar CSS variables correctly behind the scenes.</p><p>Until this is fixed, you can fix it manually by adding the following CSS rule to your <code>theme/variables.scss</code> file:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">ion-toolbar {
  ion-button,
  ion-back-button,
  ion-menu-button,
  .sc-ion-back-button-ios-h {
    --color: white;
  }
}</pre>

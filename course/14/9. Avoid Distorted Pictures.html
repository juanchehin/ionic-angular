<p>In the previous lecture, I showed how you can set the <code>width</code> and/ or <code>height</code> of the taken picture by passing the <code>width</code>/ <code>height</code> properties to the object you use for configuring the photo.</p><p>Of course, you might want to <strong>only use one of the two properties</strong> to avoid distorted images. Hence for this course, I recommend simply going with a <code>width: 600</code> or something along these lines.</p>
